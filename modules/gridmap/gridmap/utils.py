    """Inflates obstacles in an occupancy grid

    Creates a mask for all grid cells exceeding the obstacle threshold and
    uses a convolution to compute how much the obstacles should inflate. The
    inflated mask is used to set the cells of a copy of the initial grid to
    occupied. All other cells are unchanged: free space and unnoccupied cells
    outside of the inflation radius are preserved (therefore, frontiers can
    still be computed from an inflated grid).

    Args:
        grid (np.Array): occupancy grid
        inflation_radius (float): radius (in grid units) to inflate obstacles.
            Note that this is a float; a fractional inflation radius can be
            used to determine whether or not corners of a box are included.
        obstacle_threshold (float): value above which a cell is an obstacle.
        collision_val (float): value obstacles are given after inflation.

    Returns:
        inflated_grid (np.Array): grid with inflated obstacles.
