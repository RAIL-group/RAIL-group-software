# Environments: Tools for Procedural Environment Generation and Loading

This module manages many of the common environments we use in our simulated experiments, focusing on navigation through building-like spaces. The module is best explained by example, for which we refer to the Jupyter notebook [showcasing some generated environments from this module](../../resources/notebooks/environments-playground.ipynb).
