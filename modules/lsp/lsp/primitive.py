"""
Functions and Classes useful for determining useful properties of motion
primitives.

A Motion_Primitive is, at its core, a set of poses and a cost. Other functions,
including 'is_primitive_in_collision' and 'get_motion_primitive_costs' are used
to determine properties of the primitives as they relate to the cost grid.
